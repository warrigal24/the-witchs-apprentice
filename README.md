# The Witch's Apprentice

By Garry Francis

## Background

Your name is Susan. You are 14 years old and you have ambitions of becoming a witch. You have just completed two years of study at the Spooksville Academy of Witchcraft. You reckon you know all the theory and now it's time to put that theory into practice.

As with all trades, you must start out as an apprentice. You've been allocated to Broomhilda, the old witch that lives in the spooky house on the outskirts of town. The other girls say that she's really mean, but she sure knows her hexes and potions.

It's Halloween and you've just arrived at the front gate to Broomhilda's house. You only have a few necessities with you. The first thing you'll have to do is find Broomhilda. After that, who knows?

This is a traditional text adventure that was originally written for the [Adventuron Halloween Jam](https://itch.io/jam/adventuron-halloween-jam), 4 October to 2 November 2019.
