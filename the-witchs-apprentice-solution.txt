Solution by Garry Francis
----------------------------------------
This is a minimal solution. You'll need to EXAMINE lots of things for this solution to make sense. Make sure you examine EVERYTHING, as there are lots of useful hints and funny responses. A few optional (but significant) commands are shown in parentheses. You can omit these once you know what to do.

Your initial objective is to find the witch so that you can get your instructions. She gives you a list of eight ingredients that she needs to make a brew. The ingredients are:
    Eye of newt
    Wing of bat
    Hemlock root
    Tail of rat
    Poison fruit
    Toe of frog
    Leather boot
    Moss of bog

Note that two of these ingredients are the same as ingredients from the famous witches' brew in Shakespeare's 'Macbeth'. In Shakespeare's time, it was common for herbs to be given fanciful names, so you will need to work out the actual names for those two items. Don't panic, the game tells you everything you need to know.

Nearly all the ingredients are easy to find, but some are hard to get, as there are multiple elements to most of the puzzles. As you acquire the ingredients, your tally is shown in the solution as (A/B), where A is the number of ingredients acquired and B is the total number of ingredients. You don't earn any points for the ingredients until you give them to the witch, 5 points per ingredient. Scores are shown in the solution as (+C=D), where C is points earned and D is cumulative points earned.

This game is chock full of red herrings. Part of the challenge is working out what's useful and what isn't. Your inventory is limited to 5 items, so you will need to make at least two trips to the basement. If you manage your inventory carefully and discard items when you're finished with them, you can do it in two trips.
